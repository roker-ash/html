<h2>Non Vegetable Dishes</h2>
<p>
    Non-vegetable dishes are foods made using meat, fish, eggs, or poultry. These dishes are known for their rich flavors and higher protein content. They are often eaten during special occasions, family meals, or to get extra strength and energy.
</p>
<p>
    These meals provide essential nutrients such as protein, iron, and vitamin B12. When eaten in moderation and cooked properly, non-vegetable dishes support muscle growth and overall body development.
