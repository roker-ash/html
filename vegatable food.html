<h2>Vegetable  Dishes</h2>
<p>
    Vegetable dishes are meals prepared mainly from plant-based ingredients like leafy greens, root vegetables, and legumes. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, making them essential for a balanced diet. These dishes are often lighter, easier to digest, and suitable for people of all ages.
</p>
<p>
    Each type provides different flavors and nutrient combinations, supporting overall health. Because they are low in fat and high in antioxidants, vegetable dishes help maintain good digestion and boost immunity.
